        One tip? “The pasta should be fully cooked through to al dente,” says Kunkel. “However right before you add the pasta to the mornay, you want to flash it in boiling water for 45 seconds.” As always, use your gut feel to make sure that the pasta has some bite for it to hold up while being cooked in the mornay sauce.</p>
